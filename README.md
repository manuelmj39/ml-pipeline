## END to END Machine Learning Pipeline 
Here, we will be walk through end to end implementation of a Machine Learning Pipeline. We will also be covering all the techniques that are done in a machine learning projects through out the learning. 


Initial setup to do:
1. Set up Github repo
   
	a. New Environment â€”> in VS CODE itself (inside the project folder)

	b. setup.py

	c. requirements.txt

2. Create src folder and build the package.

3. Project Structure, Logging, Exceptions
	a. create src -> components

	b. add necessary modules to src -> components

	c. create src -> pipeline

	d. Add src -> logger.py, exception.py, utils.py
